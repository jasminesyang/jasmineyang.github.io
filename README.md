# About Me
Hi everyone! My name is Jasmine Yang, and I'm from Onalaska, WI. I'm the oldest in my family and have two younger brothers and a younger sister. I spend a lot of time with friends and family, and I usually enjoy everything as long as I’m with them. A little about me, I have a wide range of interests: I enjoy going to concerts, taking trips, playing volleyball, and taking pictures. I also love to spend time scrapbooking, crocheting, and doing nails.

I’m 22 years old and a first-year student in the IT Data Analytics program. My goal is to graduate in the spring of 2027. After that, I hope to find a job in the IT field, perhaps at a place like Emplify Health or at Kwik Trip. I believe I would be a great Data Analyst because I pay attention to details as well as exact precision. I also grew up with multiple members of my family who work in this field, and I find it interesting when looking into careers.

Some of my goals are to graduate college in 2027 and hopefully transfer to a 4 year, get a stable job with my career, and to get my nail tech license by 2027.
